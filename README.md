# FavoriteRecipes

This iOS Application was developed by retrieving data from the mealDB API and using UICollectionView. FavoriteRecipes is a work in progress that I look to refine as I continue along my iOS Development journey.

- This project creates a database of the user's favorite recipes
- The user can look up recipes by name
- The user can save their favorite recipes 

- I persisted the favorite recipes data by utilizing the UserDefaults Framework
- Used CocoaPods to integrate the Alamofire and SDWebImage libraries for streamlining network requests and cache support for downloaded images

# favoriteRecipes

My first iOS project retrieving data from a public API and using UICollectionView. FavoriteRecipes is a work in progress that I look to refine as I continue along my iOS Development journey.

- This project creates a database of the user's favorite recipes
- The user can look up recipes by name in the mealDB API
- The user can save their favorite recipes 

- I persisted the favorite recipes data by utilizing UserDefaults and NSCoding Protocol 
- Used CocoaPods to integrate the Alamofire and SDWebImage libraries for streamlining network requests and cache support for downloaded images
